## Setup

for Installing `rust` and `cargo`

**windows:** [Windows Installation File Download](https://win.rustup.rs/)  
**linux/mac** [Unix Bases installation steps](https://rustup.rs/)

```bash
cargo run
```

## `sass` Setup

whatever scss compiler you use it is upto you.
And add it into the `.gitignore` file.

```git
# other excluded files and folders

**/sass-dart.exe
**/sass_dev/**

```

commands

```powershell
# windows
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
cd static
.\dev\dart-sass-windows\sass.bat --watch scss:css 
```

```linux
./sass-linux --watch static/scss:static/css
```

So `css` should be generated by the developer only.

## Commit Strategy

- `git switch main`
- always branch from `main / dev-stable` whatever is latest. `git branch <feature-name>`
- name your branch by your feature name amd `git switch <feature-name>`
- add only the files you changed explicitly using `git add`
- `git commit` and write the commit message.
- commit message should as template below.

```COMMIT
