# FindCollege

The project contains the frontend of findcollege.
This is loosely constructed on `rust`.

## Setup

for Installing `rust` and `cargo`

**windows:** [Windows Installation File Download](https://win.rustup.rs/)  
**linux/mac** [Unix Bases installation steps](https://rustup.rs/)

```bash
cargo run
```

## `sass` Setup

whatever scss compiler you use it is upto you.
And add it into the `.gitignore` file.

```git
# other excluded files and folders

**/sass-dart.exe
**/sass_dev/**/

```

So css should be generated by the developer only

## Commit Strategy

- `git switch main`
- always branch from `main / dev-stable` whatever is latest. `git branch `
- name your branch by your feature name
- add only the files you changed explicitly using `git add`
-
